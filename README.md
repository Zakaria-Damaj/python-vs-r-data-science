# Comparing Python and R for Data Science 🐍📊📈

This research explores and compares the performance of **Python** and **R** in conducting **hierarchical clustering**, with a focus on **CPU and RAM usage**. It highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each language for data science tasks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📂 Performed hierarchical clustering using the **same dataset** in Python and R
- 📉 Analyzed performance based on **CPU usage** and **RAM consumption**
- 🔍 Investigated differences in **library implementations** and **efficiency**
- 📊 Visualized clustering with **dendrograms** and interpreted results

---


## 📌 Final Conclusion

This study concludes that **both Python and R** are capable of efficiently performing **hierarchical clustering** on small datasets. However:

- **Python** demonstrated **slightly better performance** in terms of:
  - **Lower RAM usage** (130 MB vs. 168 MB)
  - **Faster CPU processing** (0.6s vs. 0.9s)
  - **Stronger popularity growth**, especially among experienced professionals

- **R** remains a powerful tool for statistical computing, offering:
  - Advanced visualization libraries like `ggplot2`
  - Tailored packages for social sciences and research
  - Simpler syntax for complex statistical operations

📌 **Bottom Line:**  
Your choice should depend on the **project needs**, your **familiarity with the language**, and whether you prioritize **flexibility (Python)** or **statistical depth and visualization (R)**.

Both tools are valuable and can even complement each other in a data science workflow.
